      <p>Let us examine the basics - what are domain names and why domain names? Domain names are IP addresses, say, 301.12.21.01 converted into more specific names that are easy to remember, say, google. Now, what is an IP address? It is a unique address given to every website so that anybody can access the site through its IP address. </p>
     <h2>What is .com?</h2>
     <p>Well, .com is defined as a Top Level Domain or TLD or extensions(slang - language). Top-level domain like .com is placed after the primary domain name of the sites. <span style="font-weight: 600; font-style: italic;">"While the domain gives a unique identity to the website, the TLD or .com depicts that it is a website. " </span></p>
     <p>Imagine if say my site is Sneha-Singh..... It looks so odd, isn't it? It doesn't even seem like it's a website name. So to overcome the issue and build recognition that the name announced is a website, we use TLDs.
    </p>
    <h2>Why is .com so famous?</h2>
    <p>Now apparently, .com is not the only top-level domain. There are many other field-specific TLDs present in the market; for instance, check the list below -</p>
      
   <ul>
       <li>.com- generalized TLD.</li>
       <li>.co - another generalized higher-level domain for websites.</li>
       <li>.org- a domain that signifies that the site demonstrates an organization.</li>
       <li>.edu - depicts an educational site.</li>
       <li>.gov - signifies a governmental site.</li>
       <li>.mil - reserved for military sites mainly in the USA.</li>
   </ul>
 <p>However, there are hundreds of Top Level Domains and millions of websites domains but then why .com is extremely common and extensively utlized. <span style="font-weight: 600; font-style: italic;">Again the answer is very common .com is adopted in the mindset of humankind. With the pattern of time, human beings have become immensely familiar with the term .com. 
</span></p>
<p>So whenever someone says you hey, my website is from the name big-money...what will be the most common extension, you guess? Well, if it would be me, it must indeed have been .com. Having a .com does not mean that website is fully legit or licensed. It is just a familiar and favourite TLD that by time has come in the tendency of people.</p>
<p>So now when you know it all, here are some fun facts related to it.com -</p>
<ul>
    <li>.com are 40% more memorable to all human beings than the URLs consisting of other top-level domains. </li>
    <li>When folks forget URLs, they are 45.5% more likely to guess that it ends with .com.</li>
    <li>.com is the world's number one most reliable and trusted TLD.</li>
</ul>

<p>Last but not least, .com is always in the spotlight when it comes to websites. So how are you planning to end your domain with .com or .in or something else?</p>
