    <p>Are you wrapping around frameworks like React, jQuery, Angular, etc.? Frameworks are incredible, and mainly they make the lives of coders a whole lot easier. However, what if I say that if you want to make good relationships with MNCs ....lol. Now by that, I mean if you seriously want to break through the crowd and land some excellent jobs at tech-giants, then buddy, you seriously need to grab command over Vanilla JS(by the way, Vanilla means plain or pure javascript).</p>
    <span style="font-weight: 600;">VanillaJS for creating your value in the market.</span>
    <p>I am not studying in any of the top-tier colleges, and it does not mean that if you are studying in IITs or NITs, you don't need javascript. If you want to get better at ReactJS, then VanillaJS will make your abstraction much more powerful and wise. All in all, you can not become a true genius by skipping the basics. Below are some key highlights to depict the importance of VanillaJS at a glance - </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Most MNCs like Flipkart, Microsoft, PayPal, Netflix, Google etc., ask big mind-storming questions on VanillaJS. They filter you based on these factors also.</li>
        <li>Netflix utterly removed ReactJS from its login page to make the page much faster. You know the disadvantage of ReactJS now.</li>
        <li>VanillaJS is much stronger and faster than its higher-level frameworks. Just like C, it's much closer to machine language than the frameworks. </li>
    </ul>
    <span style="font-weight: 600;">Solid proofs for Why young engineers need to learn VanillaJS?</span>
    <p>Let us talk about the facts. In India, which has more than a billion people, more than 40 lakh engineers are passed out of college every year. More interestingly, out of these 40 lakhs graduated youngsters, only 40 thousand get into decent jobs. A more heart-threatening fact is that around 20-30 lakhs or even more engineers remain jobless. </p>
    <p>There was a time when Mr. Man Mohan Singh was the Prime Minister of India. In one of his speeches, he said something like this - "Beggars are not choosers." This very thought sparked a fire of hatred among the rural class and below a middle-class group of folks in the nation. Now let us keep our emotions aside and think practically. Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, dropped out of Harward for following his true passion. Take this scenario in India, and youngsters don't have that rich alternative to choose from like in developed economies of the USA. </p>
    <p>In the end, let's not play with the odds, and if you want to evolve as an engineer and take your career forwards, Vanilla can be a good option. However, that does not mean that if you do not know this, you are not a software developer and let nobody define your knowledge. Lastly, it is just a matter of choice. If you aspire for big technical organizations, then VanillaJS can not be just an option for you. <span style="font-weight: 500;">You work for what you choose..so what is your choice? Think twice, and think about it again. </span></p>
